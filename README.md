<b>Project I</b>

<p>In this project, we did five different tasks using shell script. In the first, we read a file with numbers and printed as many stars as each number. In the second, we deleted all the files in a directory that did not meet some conditions. In the third, we found all the given first words in the given file and replaced them with the second given word. In the fourth, we created two directories and put the largest file in one and the smallest in the other. In the fifth, we reversed and added the digits of the given number in pairs.</p>

<b>Project II</b>

<p>In this project, we wrote a simple shell in C. This shell can run some simple commands we added. A hierarchy is provided by creating threads between processes.</p>
